# SVM_Classification_of_Portuguese_Battles

Summary:

*	Predicted the outcome of Portuguese battles from the number of Portuguese, Dutch, and English ships involved as well as Spanish involvement.
*	Fit a SVM classifier in Python using 5-fold stratified cross-validation to predict whether a Portuguese battle resulted in a win, loss, or draw.
*	Concluded that the model produced low average accuracies (roughly 40%) due to the small size of the dataset and imbalanced classes. It was determined that significantly more data would be needed.
